DNS GateWay (dns-gw)

DNS GateWay provides a simple programmable dns service by invoking a
shell script provided by the administrator to lookup addresses.

For each dns query received on the udp port, dns-gw invokes the script
with the name, class and type from the query as command line arguments.
The script should write out the relevant IP addresses to standard output
in presentation format (ascii) - one address per line, and then exit.
Addresses should match the type specified in the arguments, i.e.  IPv4
for 'A' and IPv6 for 'AAAA'.

A slightly more sophisticated configuration can be achieved by
specifying a directory rather than an individual script.  dns-gw will
search this directory for a script matching the name being queried or as
much of the domain name as possible. Queries which have no match will
be ignored so as not to invite re-tries.

There is a time limit of 3 seconds on each invocation of the script,
after which, dns-gw will attempt to terminate the process. If desired,
compiled executable programs may be used instead of shell scripts.


Invoking: dns-gw requires two parameters; the udp port number and the
path for the script or directory of scripts, as follows:

	$ dns-gw <port> <script path>


Directives: dns-gw also understands the following directives in the
output of the shell script (each must be on a separate line which starts
with a '$' sign). Directives are not case sensitive.

	$ttl (seconds)
	Sets the time-to-live of any subsequent addresses provided.

	$cname (cname)
	Treats the queried name as an alias and provides the canonical
	name for it. This must be output before any IP addresses.

	$return (code)
	Specifies an explicit return code for dns-gw to respond with
	for this query. (code) can be any of 'noerror', 'formerr',
	'servfail', 'nxdomain', 'notimp', 'refused' or the actual
	numeric value (0 - 15).  All addresses will be discarded where
	the return code is non-zero.
